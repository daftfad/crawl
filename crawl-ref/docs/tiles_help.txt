Crawl 0.5 renders graphics using OpenGL and SDL.  For most video cards,
this should be faster than the 0.4 version.  However, the default driver
that ships with Windows is extremely slow.  If you are having performance
problems, be sure to update your video card driver as a first step.

It has been tested successfully with cards as old as the i865.  Unfortunately,
it has been known to be slow on the i810 and there is little to be done in that
case but to run the console version instead or switch to a different machine.
