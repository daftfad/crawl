%%%%
A dry fountain
%%%%
A fountain of clear blue water

'q'uaff to drink from this fountain. But it's far more pretty than useful, unless you're trying to fetch the Orb without eating, I guess.
%%%%
A fountain of blood

'q'uaff to drink from this fountain, if you absolutely wish to.
%%%%
A fountain of sparkling water

'q'uaff to drink from this magic fountain. Expect magical effects, as long as it's still magic.
%%%%
A gate leading back out of this place
%%%%
A gate leading out of Pandemonium
%%%%
A gate leading to another region of Pandemonium
%%%%
A one-way gate leading to the halls of Pandemonium

Tales about successful loots of these netherworlds are rare. Even the
strongest and most experienced characters can die there. On the other hand,
these halls contain several runes and lots of valuable items. It is much
easier to get in than to get out.
%%%%
A gate to the Realm of Zot

Zot is the final stage as its deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot.
Both the Orb and this Realm have a fearsome and questionable reputation but
one piece of information seems to be for certain: the monsters inhabiting
this area and protecting the orb are strong and strange -- some of them nowhere
encountered but here.
%%%%
A gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place
to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better
stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.
Once you hear the clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the
impromptu marketplace before the caravan moves on!

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to
appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave
quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.
%%%%
A gateway leading out of the Abyss

A gateway out of this accursed place, shimmering and shifting in the
impermanent landscape.

%%%%
A gateway to the freezing wastes of Cocytus

From the frost-bitten lands, a cold chill touches your soul.
%%%%
A glowing drain

Every settlement brings forth the unpleasant sewers and drains, ignored by
most but hideaways for others. Old tales speak of dangerous creatures,
bathing in disgustingly smelling green water, preying on each other without mercy.
The tales also allude to valuable items left by daring and unfortunate
visitors, left to grow mildew in the damp caverns.

impermanent and whimsical, filled with creatures out of nightmare.
%%%%
A rock wall
%%%%
A roughly hewn altar of Beogh
%%%%
A sand-covered staircase

You can make out a staircase leading downwards into a small tomb. Sand

the staircase will be gone. They say that some distant relatives of the
pharaohs were entombed here.
%%%%
A shimmering altar of Xom
%%%%
A shining altar of Vehumet
%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a
secretive and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with,
grants no refunds, and is interested in nothing you may have to sell.
Some shops hawk antiques of unknown provenance, and offer little hint
as to the quality or nature of their goods.
%%%%

%%%%
A staircase to the Slime Pits

in secret chambers without door or window for acid to leak in.

A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
A wall of solid wax

These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will
manipulate bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs,
not the bees'.) They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given
sufficient heat.

Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would try to set
foot into it, apart from those who fly or swim. Let it be a warning for you:
many confused adventurers found their death at the depths, and an untimely
end of levitation drowned even more hopeful trespassers.
%%%%
Some lava

An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This waist-deep, misty water makes movement and combat cumbersome for landlubbers - sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
