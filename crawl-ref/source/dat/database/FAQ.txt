# Beginners' questions about playing the game.
##############################################
%%%%
Q:goal

What exactly is the goal of this game?
%%%%
A:goal

A: To survive and to win, obviously. For this you need to find the fabled
Orb of Zot deep down in the dungeon and bring it back to the surface.
To enter the realm of Zot, you'll first need to collect three runes to be
found in various branches of the dungeon.

However, if you're new to the game you really shouldn't worry about this.
Just try to delve as deeply as possible and have fun exploring the many
side branches in Crawl with various characters of different species,
skill sets, and religions.
%%%%
Q:drop

How can I drop/pick up only part of a stack?
%%%%
A:drop

A: Press 'd' (or ','/'g'), followed by a number (the amount), and finally
the item's letter. For pickup, this is only possible when choosing items
from a menu, i.e. ',,' or 'gg'.
Stacks that are selected only in part are marked with '#' rather than '+'.
%%%%
Q:downstairs

I can't find any downstairs. Am I missing something?
%%%%
A:downstairs

A: While this might be a bug, chances are the downstairs are somewhere in
a room closed off by a secret door. If you search (with '5') in suspicious
looking corridors and along walls near empty terrain, you will eventually
find one. Note that most levels feature three downstairs as well as three
upstairs, not counting any escape hatches. If you get stuck, you might
try another set of stairs from the level above.
Alternatively, if you are in one of the branches, you might also have
reached its lowest level and have to turn around to explore another one.
Check the database ('?/b') for the number of levels per branch.
%%%%
Q:stuck

I teleported and ended up in a closed room without any exits. Am I stuck?
%%%%
A:stuck

A: Hopefully not. Search all the walls with '5' in case there's a secret
door. If you really can't find any, it could be a bug and need fixing, so
please report it on our SourceForge tracker. In the meantime, you can try
to escape with digging, disintegration or teleportation.
%%%%
Q:survival

How can I avoid dying all the time? Can you give me some playing tips?
%%%%
A:survival

A: If you've got trouble even reaching the Temple, you might want to try
out the Tutorial for some general playing hints. (To do this, press
'Ctrl-T' in the character selection menu.)
Also, there are easy playing combinations and more challenging ones
(marked in dark grey on the selection screen). If you are new to Crawl,
sticking to the easier ones is advisable. In general, treat each new
monster you meet with utmost caution and keep an eye on your hit points
and magic.

For specific hints dealing with a particular character, you can press '#'
in-game to create a "dump" in your morgue folder that you can then post on
the rec.games.roguelike.misc group or in the Something Awful forum, so
other players can comment on your equipment, skills or spell selection.
Please try to trim your dump by removing stuff unnecessary for this task
(such as the extensive Vanquished list). If you join the ##crawl channel
of the freenode IRC, you will find helpful souls who will even watch you
and give hints should you play on one of the public servers.
%%%%
Q:cheating

Is there a cheating mode to Crawl where I can play without dying?
%%%%
A:cheating

A: Not a cheating mode, exactly, but if your build supports it you can
play in wizard mode (access with '&') where you are prompted whenever
you're about to die, and have access to a number of nifty commands to
create equipment, travel to distant branches, or fiddle with your stats
or skills.
Note that wizard mode games will never appear on the highscore list.

Many players reckon long-time use of wizard mode to be detrimental to your
playing skills. On the other hand, wizard mode has its uses: we are really
thankful whenever we get bug reports using wizard mode for reproducing and
exploring bugs.
%%%%
Q:weapons

I've got two cool weapons. How can I tell which one is better?
%%%%
A:weapons

A: "Better" depends on a number of factors, such as your weapon skills,
whether it's one or two-handed, the randart properties, the weapon brand,
and the monsters you're about to face. In general, switching from a weapon
type you are already highly skilled with to another one that you have no
skill in is a waste of time. The brands may greatly differ in damage output
but you can get a good idea by bashing a few comparatively harmless
monsters with each and comparing the results.
Of the enchantments, the second value (damage) is usually more important
than the first (accuracy) unless you hardly ever manage to hit with a
weapon.
%%%%
Q:religion

Which gods would you recommend to a beginning player?
%%%%
A:religion

A: The easiest gods to play are probably Trog (for pure fighters), Vehumet or
Sif Muna (for spellcasters), Beogh (for orcs) and Xom (for general fun).
When you reach the Temple for the first time be sure to read all gods'
descriptions and take your time in deciding which way to go.
%%%%
Q:starving

My characters keep starving. What am I doing wrong?
%%%%
A:starving

A: It's possible that you simply spend too much time on cleared levels
where not enough monsters are generated to dine on. You might also be too
choosy about what you eat: unless you are herbivorous you will have to
occasionally eat monster chunks, even those that sometimes make you sick
(coloured brown in the menu and the prompt). If you worship a god who
enjoys sacrifices pay attention to your own hunger status and wait until
the end of prayer before chopping a corpse if need be.
Also, casting (difficult) spells will make you hungry, but high
Intelligence and Spellcasting will lessen this effect. If you press 'II',
you can read about the hunger effects of your spells.
Invocations likewise often have a Food cost.
%%%%
Q:ghosts

I keep getting murdered by my own ghosts. Can I deactivate them?
%%%%
A:ghosts

A: No, you can't. On the plus side, once a ghost has been loaded onto a
level, it won't be loaded again - unless you happen to die on that level,
thus creating a bones file featuring more than one ghost.
Keep in mind that you don't absolutely have to fight every monster you meet,
and with ghosts it's even easier: they cannot leave the level they were
created on.

Alternatively, you could play a couple of strong species/job combinations
for the sole purpose of busting those ghosts, for example Berserkers or a
spellcaster who's learned Dispel Undead.
%%%%
Q:abyss

I've somehow ended up in a place called "Abyss". How do I get out of here?
%%%%
A:abyss

A: If you are in the Abyss for the first time, chances of getting out are
slim. Still, here are a few general hints:
* You need to find a gateway leading out of the Abyss. These are rare!
* Don't stick around to fight, move as much as possible!
* The Abyss wraps around, so avoid going straight into one direction.
* If you have it, use defensive equipment (weapon of protection etc.).
* Use teleportation to hopefully end up in a completely new part of the Abyss.
* Teleportation might take much longer to kick in than in the Dungeon.
* Consider switching your allegiance to Lugonu to get out of there.
%%%%
Q:randart

What do the terms "randart", "fixedart" and "egoitem" signify?
%%%%
A:randart

A: Apart from the standard items you'll find lying around in the dungeon,
you might also stumble upon artefacts which come in three varieties:

* randart: a random artefact, usually a weapon or type of armour with
  random properties such as conferring resistances or abilities
* unrandart: an artefact that looks like a randart but is really
  predefined. There's no further difference except that players "in the know"
  can recognize such an item by its special description and/or colour.
* fixedart: an artefact that does not use the random artefact properties but
  instead has unique hardcoded effects and descriptions.

None of the three types can be enchanted or branded, neither temporarily nor
permanently. There is another type of special item that pops up a bit more
often:

* egoitem: these are ordinary items with one special property. For example,
  a short sword of venom, a cap of see invisible or boots of running. These
  can be affected by enchanting scrolls and also by corrision and acids.
  Weapons of this type are branded, so you cannot brand them in other ways.
%%%%
Q:oklobs

Oklob plants suck! Are you planning to remove them at last?
%%%%
A:oklobs

A: No. We think that Oklob plants provide an interesting challenge.
Resist the urge to kill them at once. If you absolutely need to bypass them
use your resources wisely. A hint: They cannot see invisible.
%%%%
Q:instadeath

I went down these stairs and got killed instantly! Is this a bug?
%%%%
A:instadeath

A: Probably not. While your death might be due to an ill-placed vault (this
would be a bug), it is generally just really bad luck. We believe that a
game is more fun if the risk of death is real. This means that such instant
deaths cannot be fully avoided as Crawl relies on randomness for posing
challenges. It is important to realize that for highly skilled players, the
margin of such deaths is really slim...
%%%%
Q:zombified

My zombies refuse to follow me into the next level. Is this a bug?
%%%%
A:zombified

A: No, it's a deliberate design decision. As of version 0.5, zombies,
skeletons and simulacra are considered too stupid to manoeuvre along
staircases. We realize that this weakens Necromancers but we consider the
interface improvement of zombie herding becoming unfeasible to be more
important. Interestingly, this makes Necromancy and Yredelemnul more fun
than before.

Keep in mind that the same also applies to hostile undead of the same kind!

# Questions about the development process.
##############################################
Q:bug

The game keeps crashing. / I think I found a bug. What do I do?
%%%%
A:bug

A: Please submit a bug report on SourceForge, and give as much information
as you can. (What were you doing at the time? What did you expect to
happen, what happened instead? etc.) Most importantly, what version are you
playing? Sometimes a screenshot can be helpful. For crashes or
monsters/items/levels behaving oddly, we probably need a save file. To be
on the safe side, attach the entire zipped save of the character in
question. If there are error messages, please write them down. Short of a
save file, a guide on how to reproduce the crash (or bug) can be useful;
you can use wizard mode for this.

If you don't log in to SourceForge or leave an email address at least check
the thread from time to time in case we have some more questions. In any case
leave a nick so that we can refer to you in some way.

Thanks in advance!
%%%%
Q:ideas

I've got millions of ideas! Can I join the team?
%%%%
A:ideas

A: No, you can't. At least not on ideas alone.

All of the devteam members submitted a number of code intensive patches
and/or took over responsibility over an important side project before
joining. A good way to become indispensable is to help us with patches or
vaults etc.

Please submit your ideas to the Feature Requests tracker of SourceForge. If
they catch the interest of at least one coder, chances are they'll make it
into the game.

Note that your idea has better chances to be accepted if you present the
ramifications on gameplay. Since we put a lot of emphasis on the interface,
a good proposal on how to make the game play smoother may go in without much
ado.
%%%%
Q:feature

Hey! Why did you close my feature request?
%%%%
A:feature

A: If you are logged in to SourceForge when submitting your feature
request, or choose to "Monitor" the resulting thread while logged in, you
will get an email any time someone replies to (or fiddles with) this
thread. Once a thread has been closed, you can still access it by searching
for requests with the "Closed" status.

We always try to give a reason for closing a request, but it usually boils
down to three reasons:
* It doesn't fit into the Crawl world as we see it.
* It violates Crawl's philosophy to avoid grinding and spoiler-heavy stuff.
* We just don't think it's interesting enough to ever be implemented.

Please don't let this stop you from bringing up more suggestions. Already the
next one might generate heavy interest and excitement, and end up in the
game. However, do try to be specific in your suggestions. If you cannot even
explain the basics of your idea, why should we bother to flesh it out, let
alone code it?
%%%%
Q:patch

I've written a patch for a cool new feature! Where should I send it?
%%%%
A:patch

A: Please submit it to the Patches tracker on SourceForge. Keep in mind
that without previous discussions, we may not be able to use the patch, or
it might need heavy modification. In general, it is safer to first file
your suggestions under Feature Requests and wait for people to become
enthusiastic and give feedback before you submit a patch. If you want,
you can also write a patch that implements an existing FR or fixes a bug.

We really appreciate your help!
%%%%
Q:help

I cannot code, but I'd really like to help improve the game. What can I do?
%%%%
A:help

A: There are several areas where you can get creative and outside help is
much appreciated. These are:
* the maps/vaults (see dat/ folder, docs/level_design.txt)
* monster speech (see dat/database/, docs/monster_speech.txt)
* monster/item/spell descriptions (see dat/descript/)
* tiles (For this you'll need the source code, check the rltiles/ folder.)

If you've got some cool addition, you can send it over the mailing list, or
post it as a SourceForge item. You can also help us by giving feedback on
the most recent version or trunk (available via SVN, Windows binaries
downloadable from http://crawl.develz.org/trunk/).

Thanks a lot for your support!
%%%%
Q:beta

Is there a way for me to play the new version before it is released?
%%%%
A:beta

A: There certainly is! You can play "trunk" (what will eventually become
the next version) online on http://crawl.develz.org, or you can download
Windows binaries from the same site. Note that trunk may be buggy, and that
many changes will invalidate your saved games. If that doesn't bother you,
go ahead and play!
Be sure to leave some feedback/suggestions/bug reports on the SourceForge
trackers. When doing so please mention the version (r????) you're
currently playing in case the bug's already been fixed or the feature
already implemented.
%%%%
Q:interact

Is there a way for me to interact with other players?
%%%%
A:interact

A: If you play online on http://crawl.akrasiac.org or http://crawl.develz.org
you can watch games in progress, other players can watch you while you play,
and you can kill other players' ghosts. You can even send and receive
messages.

Check docs/ssh_guide.txt for an explanation about how to play online. You can
also chat in the Crawl channel (irc.freenode.net, ##crawl), or discuss in the
Something Awful forum or the rec.games.roguelike.misc newsgroup.
%%%%
Q:changes

What did you change in the most recent version?
%%%%
A:changes

A: The (admittedly highly subjective) highlights of the release are listed
along with the version information under '?v'. For more details, check out
the change log in docs/changes.stone_soup.

# Questions about the Tiles version
##############################################
Q:tiles online

Can I play Tiles online?
%%%%
A:tiles online

A: Sadly, no, that's not possible at the moment. We are planning to change
that but so far we haven't even decided how to go about it, and so it's
still far off.
If you can, do give the console version a try: playing online is certainly
worth it.
%%%%
Q:tiles graphics

Is there a way for me to replace some of the tiles with different ones?
%%%%
A:tiles graphics

A: It depends. If all you want are minor modifications such as colour
changes you can directly modify the png files in the dat/tiles/ folder.

Otherwise, you'll need to be able to compile the game. In this case you can
either directly replace the tiles in the rltiles/ subfolders, or change
their paths in the dc-xxxx.txt files. For the compilation to be successful,
you may also need to delete or rename the *.png files in rltiles/. Upon
compilation, the newly rolled *.png files are copied into the dat/tiles/
folder which is where the game accesses the tiles it needs. You can then
share these files with other players, so they can use your tileset without
having to compile the game.

If you've created some nice new tiles or variations of existing ones you'd
like to share you might want to send them over the mailing list or submit
them as a SourceForge item. It's easiest for us if they are already in
32x32 png format, preferrably zipped if there are several.

Thanks in advance!
%%%%
Q:tiles options

Is there a way to modify the size of the tiles screen, the font etc?
%%%%
A:tiles options

A: Yes. Play around with the options in settings/tiles_options.txt until
you are satisfied.
%%%%
